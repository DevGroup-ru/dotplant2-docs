After logging in you can proceed to backend : http://YOUR_HOSTNAME/backend

> **Note:** Backend uses commercial bootstrap 3 theme - SmartAdmin. Therefore theme assets(js, css, images, etc.) are loaded in backend from third-party static domains(st-[1-4].dotplant.ru). 
> 
> Please consider [buying SmartAdmin license](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/smartadmin-responsive-webapp-WB0573SK0?ref=dotplant_ru_cms) for your project if you want to modify original files or relocate them to another domain.
> 
> Until you don't change this assets location you don't need to buy separate license.
