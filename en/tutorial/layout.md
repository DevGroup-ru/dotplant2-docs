# Creating a Layout

By default, the file is generated layout, similar to what comes with default CMS theme.

To start disable widgets that go here by default.
To do this, go to the administration panel (http://localhost/backend) and go to "Settings - Configuration" section. In the "Default theme" go to "Widgets and parts" (blue button).

In this section, we will remove all unnecessary widgets us in all variations.

## Making his cap

Our widget caps will be located in the `web/theme/module/widgets/Header.php`.
