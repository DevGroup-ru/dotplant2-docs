    [
        'formId' => 1,
    ]
)
?>
```

In addition there are a number of additional parameters:

- `id` - the id (the default is generated by Yii);
- `isModal` - (default `false`);
- `formId` - ID form (required parameter);
- `route` - Route to which to send the form data (default `'default/submit-form'`);
- `options` - html-array of options (default `['data-type' => 'form-widget']`).

### An example of the form in a modal window

First, add the code in the page call form widget

```php
<?=
\app\widgets\form\Form::widget(
    [
        'formId' => 1,
        'id' => 'callback',
        'isModal' => true,
    ]
)
?>
```

Then connect the modal window call to link (`<a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal-form-callback">Show</a>`) or button (`<button data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal-form-callback"></button>`). Now when you click on these elements, we will open a modal window with a form.

Important! `data-target` formed as follows `#modal-form-` + ID form.

You can also call the modal window with jQuery `jQuery('#modal-form-callback').modal('show');`.
