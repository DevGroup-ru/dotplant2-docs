# Measures

> In DotPlant2 supports products with different units.
  
  To add, change, or delete the measures you must go to the section `Shop/Measures` administrative panel.

Editing form consists of only three fields:

* `name` - the name of the action;
* `symbol` - designation symbol;
* `nominal` - the number of delivered goods (used in counting the cart and does not allow the user to enter the quantity of goods which is not equal to `N x nominal`).

> ** Important ** For convenience, it is desirable to set the default measure, which will be set when creating a new product. This can be done through the `Settings/Config`, `Shop` tab, `Cart and orders` section.
