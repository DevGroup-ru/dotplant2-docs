# Water marks

> Section `Images/Watermark` contains a list of watermarks and the ability to edit them. They can be used to create thumbnails of uploaded images via the admin panel.

Form editing watermark contains only two fields:

* Image - watermark image;
* Position - the watermark position on the thumbnail.

DotPlant2 supports the ability to specify arbitrary watermark for each thumbnail. This is done in the [Image/Thumbnails] (image-thumbnail.md).

> *To support the watermark you must include them in the settings module `Images`.*
