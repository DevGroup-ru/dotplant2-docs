# Configuration Application

> All the basic configuration DotPlant2 CMS can be done through the administration panel. All entries are checked for compliance (are validated), which excludes the possibility of a mistake. In addition there is no need to edit the files by hand.

All settings are made in separate tabs on the module, and there they are grouped into different blocks.

Button `Save` records absolutely all settings regardless of on which tab you're on.
