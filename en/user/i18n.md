> In DotPlant2 realized the possibility of internationalization of your applications. At the moment there are 3 available language:
>
> * English;

Translation is carried out with the English language to a specified during installation. You can edit the files in the `Setting/I18n` in CMS administration panel. The first thing that you see in this section - a list of available translations and click "Edit" next to each of them.

Translation editing window consists of the editor, the checkbox `Sort by source messages` and` Save` button. By default, files are not available for recording (as reported by the window over form). It is necessary to ask for them by the owner who runs the Web server (usually www-data). After that, this feature is available.

If you need to add your own expressions and translations for them, it is better to create a category of translation and work with it. More information can be found in [Documents Yii Framework2](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-tutorial-i18n.html).
