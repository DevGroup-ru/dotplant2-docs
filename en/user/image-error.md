Broken Image #

> In the `Images/Broken Image` stored references to objects (both frontend and backend on) with bad images and the type of "lost" images (the image thumbnail or watermark).

The challenge for the imaging scan is performed every hour, but you can put an extra task for review at any time by clicking on `Find Broken Images`. The verification process takes place as follows: first, the table is cleared with errors, and then carried out on all the images pass and check their availability.

Also, verification is carried out by reference to the image (not the task).

> *Important! To perform the job you need to [configure background tasks](background-tasks.md).*
